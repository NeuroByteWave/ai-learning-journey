# Week 1 - reviewðŸ“…

## **Day 1**
On the first day I went through the first module called Introduction and History of AI which is a part of Microsoft AI for beginners programme. (Link: https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners)
I took brief notes on that course which are in this folder Week 1.

I than proceeded to install VS Code and installed Python extensions. I than wrote two codes, one for the simple calculator and a code for temperature converter. I put that code in the Week 1 folder.

I finished the day by setting up my GitHub account and creating this project and organizing folders within it.

## **Day 2**
On the second day I took a deep dive into python to remind myself of certain things I learned in highschool.
With the help of chatbots like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok etc. I wrote and organized code for a simple Contact Book that can be found in Week 1 folder.

## **Day 3**
On the third day I covered classes and objects in Python. For practice created a student list and went through the third module of AI for beginners course by Microsoft.
Went through NumPy course as well.

## **Day 4**
Started watching Harvard CS50 AI Start course - lecture 0.
Cloned the codebase and did Degrees.py task.

## **Day 5**
I spent whole day looking into making a chatbot but turned out way harder than I thought so I made one that is not AI as it has no intelligence.

## **Day 6**
Nothing much happend on day 6 as I was still looking into this chatbot.

## **Day 7**
Day 7 was a review of the last week and letting it all sink in.
