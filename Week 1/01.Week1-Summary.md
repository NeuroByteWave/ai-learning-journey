#Week 1 - review

**##Day 1**
On the first day I went through the first module called Introduction and History of AI which is a part of Microsoft AI for beginners programme. (Link: https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners)
I took brief notes on that course which are in this folder Week 1.

I than proceeded to install VS Code and installed Python extensions. I than wrote two codes, one for the simple calculator and a code for temperature converter. I put that code in the Week 1 folder.

I finished the day by setting up my GitHub account and creating this project and organizing folders within it.
