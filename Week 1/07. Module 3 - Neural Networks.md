# Machine Learning

Neural networks are a part of a larger discipline callend **Machine Learning**, whose goal is to use data to train computer models that are able to solve problems.
In Machine Learning, we assume that we have some dataset of examples X, and corresponding output values Y. Examples are often N-dimensional vectors that consist of features, and outputs are called labels.

## Two most common machine learning problems:
  - Classification: we need to classify an input object into two or more classes
  - Regression: we need to predict a numerical number for each of the input samples


## Perceptron

**Perceptron** - is the simplest type of artificial neural network, inspired by how neurons work in the brain. It’s basically a decision-making machine that takes input, processes it, and gives an output — like answering "yes" or "no" to a question.
Python code for training Perceptron:

**Formalization of Machine Learning**

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of study where we teach machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Let's start with formalizing the Machine Learning problem. Suppose we have a training dataset X with labels Y, and we need to build a model f that will make most accurate predictions. The quality of predictions is measured by Loss function ℒ. The following loss functions are often used:

 - For regression problem, when we need to predict a number, we can use absolute error ∑i|f(x(i))-y(i)|, or squared error ∑i(f(x(i))-y(i))2
 - For classification, we use 0-1 loss (which is essentially the same as accuracy of the model), or logistic loss.
For one-level perceptron, function f was defined as a linear function f(x)=wx+b (here w is the weight matrix, x is the vector of input features, and b is bias vector). For different neural network architectures, this function can take more complex form.

**Gradient Descent Optimization**

There is a well-known method of function optimization called gradient descent. The idea is that we can compute a derivative (in multi-dimensional case called gradient) of loss function with respect to parameters, and vary parameters in such a way that the error would decrease. This can be formalized as follows:

Initialize parameters by some random values w(0), b(0)
Repeat the following step many times:
w(i+1) = w(i)-η∂ℒ/∂w
b(i+1) = b(i)-η∂ℒ/∂b
During training, the optimization steps are supposed to be calculated considering the whole dataset (remember that loss is calculated as a sum through all training samples). However, in real life we take small portions of the dataset called minibatches, and calculate gradients based on a subset of data. Because subset is taken randomly each time, such method is called stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

**Multi-Layered Perceptrons and backpropagation**

One-layer network, as we have seen above, is capable of classifying linearly separable classes. To build a richer model, we can combine several layers of the network. Mathematically it would mean that the function f would have a more complex form, and will be computed in several steps:

z1=w1x+b1
z2=w2α(z1)+b2
f = σ(z2)
Here, α is a non-linear activation function, σ is a softmax function, and parameters θ=<w1,b1,w2,b2>.

The gradient descent algorithm would remain the same, but it would be more difficult to calculate gradients. Given the chain differentiation rule, we can calculate derivatives as:

∂ℒ/∂w2 = (∂ℒ/∂σ)(∂σ/∂z2)(∂z2/∂w2)
∂ℒ/∂w1 = (∂ℒ/∂σ)(∂σ/∂z2)(∂z2/∂α)(∂α/∂z1)(∂z1/∂w1)
