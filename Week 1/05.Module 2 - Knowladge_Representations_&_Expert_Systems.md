# Knowledge Representation and Expert Systems

Knowladge is a broad concept and its hard to define it so it is mostly aligned with other similar concepts using [DIKW Pyradmid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid).

## Classifying Computer Knowladge Repersentations

**Network representations** - it is a way by which a computer connects information in an information web. Instead of using thoughts it uses so called "graphs".

**Object-Attribute-Value Triplets** - or attribute-value pairs are lists of triplets containing objects, attributes and values. "Object" describes what we are talking about, "Attribuute" describes it and "Value" gives it certain value.

**Hierarchical Representations** - is a way of presenting information in a certain hierarchical order.
For an example:

Animal
   └──Bird
        └──Canary

**Frame Representations** - are like structured info-cards for objects or situations, with labeled slots that hold facts, default values, or rules, all organized in a hierarchy.

**Scenarios** - are special frames that describe typical sequences of events in a situation, showing what usually happens step-by-step over time.
