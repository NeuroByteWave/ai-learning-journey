# Module 1 - Introduction to AI

## Introduction and history of AI

**Weak AI** - weak AI is a system which is trained for preforming a specific task or a narrow set of tasks (Siri, Alexa)

**Strong AI** - Systems which posess a human-like intelligence and ability to understand (this is a long-term goal of AI research)

**Turing Test** - a real person needs to interact with both a human and an AI and if they can't see a difference it means an AI model passed the Turing test

**Eugene Goostman** - is an AI chat-bot developed in St.Petersburg, Russia and it almost passed the Turning test in 2014 after presenting as a 13-year old boy from Ukraine.

There are two approaches of programming intelligence into a machine:

1. **Top-down Approach (Symbolic reasoning)**
    - you are telling the machine exactly what to do using rules, strategies and logic
  
2.**Bottom-up Approach (Machine learning)**    
    - start with simple building blocks and let the machine learn patterns from data
  
3. **There are some other possible approaches like emergent, synergetic or multi-agent approach**
